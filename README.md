## Concept
Start planning your journey with strangers, travelers, family and friends! This online tool let's you explore the globe with real time data. Data includes stories, locations, weather information and pictures!

See what your partner is pinpointing on the map and discover what amazing trips you can create within a view minutes!

## API's

### Google Maps API
The Google Maps API is a Javascript driven API one puts in the script tags of the client. The client makes an API call to Google Maps in which the API sends a complete map to the client.

The map contains coordinates which can be used to place content on the map. The content can be retrieved from other API's, clients or generated by the client.

## Data
The core of this product is retrieving data, manipulating data and creating data realtime. 

### User Data
User data that I want to structure looks as follows:

```Javascript
user{
  user.id, // Unique Identifier for every new user
  user.username, // Chosen username
  user.datecreated, // Data user was created
  user.collection, // All locations in an Array that user created.
}
// Robert Hoekstra
```

### Data Generation
Data can be generated by the clients. The data that the client can generate has the following structure:
```Javascript
location{
  location.coordinates,
  location.description,
  location.category,
  location.images,
  location.date
}
// Robert Hoekstra
```

### Data Retrieving
Data will we retrieved realtime.

Two forms of data:

* Data generated realtime by other clients being online
* Data retrieved from database, consisting of already created data

Maybe I will add data from websites such as places and yelp. Not sure about this tho!

### Data Life Cycle

Note: final version will be uploader after feedback 21th april 2020!


## Storage
Data will be stored in the server client and eventually stored in an encrypted database. Probably a database hosted by MongoDB

### MongoDB
MongoDB is an online tool to create databases/collections. You can use these to make an online data storage to use for your application. Super handy!
